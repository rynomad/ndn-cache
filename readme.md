NDN-Cache
=========

This module is a pure memory NDN cache supporting namespace traversal according to ndn interest rules. It is used primarily in [ndn-forwarder](http://github.com/rynomad/nfd-js). It has been abstracted into it's own module for ease of future optimizations and potential inclusion in a caching version of [ndn-io](http://github.com/rynomad/ndn-io).
